 Assignment 1 - Bank ATM using Inheritance - March 16

Posted on: Wednesday, February 17, 2016 7:19:20 PM CST

    For this assignment you will use the puzzle pieces provided posted under 
Docs & Assignments. 
    The general code is given to you in the Account Class. 
    The other pieces show a students class and its sub classes 
(inherited/extended class) of Grad and UnderGrad students along with another 
class called RunStudent, Process Student or StudentArray
    You will need use the model provided with the student class and build a 
model for a Bank ATM
    The bank ATM must allow for three unique accounts in an array, arraylist or 
hashmap collection
    You should be allowed to select an account and then perform deposits, 
withdraws and check balances on the account selected
    Each account should be either a checking or savings account that inherits 
from the bank account class whether a class is checking or savings will 
determine via inheritance how much interest is calculated for each transaction
    The dates used to calculate interest are in the account code given to you, 
you will have to enter dates for each transaction to determine the interest this 
is evident in the account code given to you.  You will only need to assume that 
we are entering dates for the current year.
    Additionally you will need to have your program write and read from a file 
where you will write out your array of objects or you can write out in plain 
text if you want to process line by line.

Good Luck!
